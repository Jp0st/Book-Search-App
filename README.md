## Description

I developed this project to become familiar with MongoDB Server.  I set out to create an application that allowed the user to search up a book they were looking for by name.

To begin you will want to clone this repository onto your local machine and in the root folder in an integrated terminal run:

"npm i" and then "npm run develop"

from there the local build should be functioning and look like this:

## Usage

From there all you need to do is to search a book in the searchbar and it will populate the page when you do so.

If you do not want to run the application locally you can access it deployed to Heroku here:
